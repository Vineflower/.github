### Where's Quiltflower?

In short, Vineflower *is* Quiltflower- created by the same team and having the same goals, just under a new name. The reason for this shift was not due to any drama or falling out with the Quilt team, instead from a desire to expand past a focus on mainly Minecraft and create a more general Java decompiler. Quiltflower grew significantly since its inception and had always been doing its own thing on the side, and this is a natural progression of the project.
