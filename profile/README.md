### Where's Quiltflower?

In short, Vineflower *is* Quiltflower- created by the same team and having the same goals, just under a new name. The reason for this shift was mainly as the project had grown significantly since its inception, and we figured a seperate space would be more ideal for the long-term future of the project.
